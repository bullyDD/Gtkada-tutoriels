--  In GUI programming we are going to write a lot of code.
--  and doing this in a single file is not a good pratice.
--  It can become quickly a big mess. In this second tutorial
--  Ada is a multi-paradigm programming language with a lot of
--  interesting features such strong typing, POO, tasking, memory
--  management...
--  Here I will create a simple window with an embedded button 
--  by using POO approach. Package is an Ada facility that helps
--  developers to manage their code in an efficient way.
--  A package is compiled unit which is divided into two parts 
--  (spec and body).
--  Package specification (spec) can be divide into two parts 
--  (public and private). Within it you can find type declaration
--  sub-program declaration.
